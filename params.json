In 2011 she is selected as MEXT (Monbukagakusyo) scholarship research student and soon started research in [Naemura Laboratory](http://www.nae-lab.org/) at [the University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), Japan. Early 2015 she returned to Korea to join the Robot Technology Team in Samsung Electronics where she has been researched. Early 2016 Boyoung defended her PhD research on “Blind Deconvolution on 3D Fluorescence Microscopy using Depth-variant Asymmetric PSF” at the University of Tokyo.\r\n\r\n### Major Interests\r\nImage Processing (especially biomedical image, image restoration and deblurring), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Optimization \r\n\r\n### Journal Publications\r\n1.
